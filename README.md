# fluent-regex-net
This project is an experiement in building a fluent interface for building Regular Expressioins in .NET

I frequently find myself helping other developers to use Regular Expressions. 
When updating an 'intro' presentation and its support code and app, I decided a fluent interface would
enable newer users to leverage the power of RegExes.

This class is not considered complete and will likely evolve as my needs do, and as I receive feedback from 
other developers.
